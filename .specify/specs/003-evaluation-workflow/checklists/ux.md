# UX Requirements Checklist: Evaluation Workflow

**Purpose**: Validate UX requirements clarity, completeness, and measurability for the evaluation workflow UI.
**Created**: February 26, 2026
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are the exact idea detail fields and their presentation order specified for the evaluator view? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK002 Are attachment handling requirements (download vs view, file types, size limits) explicitly defined for idea details? [Gap, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK003 Are evaluation history display requirements (timeline vs list, ordering, grouping) fully specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK004 Are submitter read-only view requirements complete for all evaluation data elements (status, comments, evaluator identity, timestamps)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-012, Spec §FR-013]
- [ ] CHK005 Are status controls UI requirements specified for evaluator/admin roles (control type, placement, default state)? [Gap, Spec §User Story 2]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is "clearly displayed" status defined with measurable visual criteria (size, position, contrast, or icon usage)? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Story 4]
- [ ] CHK007 Is "visual indicators (colors, icons)" quantified with specific mappings for each status? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-004]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the required comment UX for ACCEPTED/REJECTED transitions defined with explicit validation messaging and placement? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK009 Is the meaning of "full idea details" scoped to specific fields beyond those listed (e.g., tags, links)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-004]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK010 Do the role-based UI rules for evaluators/admins align across User Stories 1, 2, and 5 without contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §User Story 5]
- [ ] CHK011 Are status transition options consistent between the workflow rules and the UI control options? [Consistency, Spec §FR-005, Spec §Technical Considerations]
- [ ] CHK012 Are comment requirements consistent between status changes and standalone comment flows? [Consistency, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-007, Spec §FR-008]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK013 Are the UX success criteria measurable (e.g., "view full details in under 3 seconds") and mapped to specific UI flows? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK014 Are response-time criteria tied to user-visible loading states or feedback requirements? [Gap, Spec §NFR-001]
- [ ] CHK015 Are "real-time" visibility expectations defined with explicit update triggers or refresh behavior? [Ambiguity, Spec §SC-005]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 Are primary evaluator flows for view, update status, and comment fully specified with UI steps and feedback states? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK017 Are submitter flows for viewing status and comments fully specified for both accepted and rejected outcomes? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 4]
- [ ] CHK018 Are admin flows explicitly defined or delegated to evaluator behavior to avoid ambiguity? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 5]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK019 Are UX requirements defined for concurrent evaluator updates (e.g., conflict messaging, refresh prompt)? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK020 Are UX requirements defined for evaluator self-review of their own ideas (visibility or restriction messaging)? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK021 Are UX requirements defined for session expiry mid-comment (draft loss or recovery behavior)? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK022 Are UX requirements defined for deleted ideas while viewing or commenting (error state, redirect)? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK023 Are UX requirements defined for very long comments (truncation, expansion, or wrapping)? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK024 Are accessibility requirements defined for keyboard navigation, focus order, and screen-reader labels for evaluation controls? [Gap, Spec §NFR-004]
- [ ] CHK025 Are UX performance requirements tied to specific UI feedback (loading indicators, skeletons) for evaluation history? [Gap, Spec §NFR-001]
- [ ] CHK026 Are immutability requirements reflected in UX (no edit/delete affordances for history entries)? [Coverage, Spec §NFR-006]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK027 Are UX dependencies on authentication and role data availability documented (e.g., role-based rendering rules)? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK028 Are UX dependencies on attachment accessibility and storage behavior specified to avoid broken UI states? [Dependency, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK029 Is the term "evaluation controls" defined with explicit UI elements and permissions? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK030 Are there any conflicts between optional comment rules and UX validation messaging requirements? [Conflict, Spec §FR-008]
